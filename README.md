# Python Projects Collection

Overview
This repository contains a collection of small Python projects, primarily developed for practice and to gain more experience with Python programming. The projects cover a range of tasks, including automation scripts, data handling, and utility applications. Each project demonstrates key concepts in Python, such as file handling, database interaction, algorithms, and more.

Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:

- Showcase my growing knowledge of Python.
- Provide examples of practical Python applications.
- Share my coding journey with the community for feedback and learning.
- Offer useful Python scripts that can be expanded or modified.
